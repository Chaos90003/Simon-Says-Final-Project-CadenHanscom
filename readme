How to run
__________

Use ./play in terminal

program only has been tested through ssh into ubuntu

no libraries were installed in the making of the project
meaning only libraries installed during lectures may be needed


Description

___________

The game is a classic take on Simon Says, with two provided difficulties

Hard mode simply adds two additional colors that can appear

user input is NOT case sensitive, and spaces in between the user input will NOT work

i.e the terminal will print R G B Y

and the user must repsond with RGBY and not R G B Y

your score will be written into scores.txt, you will have to look at it through nano as it won't reflect in vscode


Features not taught in class include:
    Clearing the terminal
    Implementing Random
    using sleep() and srand(time(NULL))
    using the ternary operator (?) for quicker if/else (I think this one is cool)
